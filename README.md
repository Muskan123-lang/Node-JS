# Node-JS
-> Node.js is an open-source runtime environment that allows JavaScript code to be executed outside the browser. 
-> It is based on the V8 JavaScript engine of Google Chrome.
-> It is mainly used for backend development.
-> Since it aims to provide dynamic content, entire sites may be operated using a single stack, which accelerates development and maintenance and liberates 
you to concentrate on the project’s commercial objectives.

-> Applications may open, add, and remove files on the database in real-time with ease using node.js. 
-> node.js is a runtime environment rather than a framework. 
-> A JavaScript engine in a runtime environment parses developers’ code using Web APIs they can access.This makes it lightweight, adaptable, and simple to 
deploy—all characteristics that will help you optimise and accelerate the development of your application.
-> Javascript modules included in the extensive Node.js library make it easier to construct web apps.

# Features of Node.JS 
The following capabilities greatly simplify the software development process for developers.
* V8
* Asynchronous
* Single-Threaded
* Unified API
* Data Streams

V8 
-> To convert javascript code to native machine code and then execute it, Google created the open-source V8 javascript engine for Chrome. This makes it possible for
better and quicker runtime performance.

Asynchronous
-> The speed at which a website or application loads is greatly improved by using node.js. This is due to node.js’s ability to handle numerous requests concurrently 
without waiting for each request’s completion. Non-blocking code execution is a design paradigm popular among developers and is one of the main causes of its popularity.

Single-Threaded
-> Using the single-threaded event loop approach, Node.js can manage multiple clients without the need to establish additional threads. This eliminates the 
performance hit associated with thread context switching and stops problems brought on by improper thread synchronization, which can be very challenging to fix.

Unified API
-> Node.js adopted well-known server-side development principles, making it simple to combine with a JSON-compatible browser or database to create a unified JavaScript
development stack.

Data Streams
-> Due to the Stream module, Node.js applications never buffer any data. Building objects that implement the stream interface is simple thanks to the stream module,
an abstract interface for interacting with streaming data.

(The JavaScript runtime is particularly well suited for developing scalable network applications because it makes it simple to output data in chunks, giving Node.js
developers the power of composability in their code.)



# What is Node JS Used For?
-> Node.js is used in practically all of the applications we use daily because of its ubiquity, which makes development easier and improves browsing.

Here are some instances of node.js’s use and how it helps consumers enjoy a seamless browsing experience: 

Chat Applications
Streaming Applications
Browser Games
Real-Time Collaboration
Internet of Things
